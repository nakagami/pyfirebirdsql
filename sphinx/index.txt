#########################################
Welcome to pyFirebirdSQL's documentation!
#########################################

pyFirebirdSQL is a `Python <http://python.org>`__ extension package that
implements `Python Database API 2.0`-compliant support for the open source relational
database `FirebirdÂ® <http://www.firebirdsql.org>`__ .
In addition to the minimal feature set of the standard Python DB API,
pyFirebirdSQL also exposes nearly the entire native client API of the database engine.

pyFirebirdSQL is free -- covered by a permissive BSD-style `license
<license.html>`__ that both commercial and noncommercial users should
find agreeable.

This documentation set is not a tutorial on Python, SQL, or Firebird;
rather, it is a topical presentation of pyFirebirdSQL's feature set,
with example code to demonstrate basic usage patterns. For detailed
information about Firebird features, see the `Firebird documentation 
<http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/documentation/>`__, and especially the excellent
`The Firebird Book <http://www.ibphoenix.com/products/books/firebird_book>`__ 
written by Helen Borrie and published by APress.
