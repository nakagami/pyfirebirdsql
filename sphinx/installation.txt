Dependencies
************

PyFirebirdSQL requires a valid combination of the dependencies in
the list below.

Detailed instructions on how to install each dependency are beyond the
scope of this document; consult the dependency distributor for
installation instructions.

Satisfying the dependencies is not difficult! For mainstream
operating systems -- including Windows and Linux -- easily installable
binary distributions are available for *all* of PyFirebirdSQL's
dependencies (see the download links below).


#. Operating System - one of:

    + Windows (32/64)
    + Linux Any Cpu (Known to work fine on both x86 and x86-64.)
    + Other Unix or Unix-like operating system (Macosx)

#. `Firebird <http://www.firebirdsql.org>`__ 1.5 or later - client or server  
   installation [`download here <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=9028>`__] (fb client is not necessary to connect to a server)

#. `Python <http://www.python.org>`__ [`download here
   <http://www.python.org/download/>`__] 2.5 or later (including Python 3.x) It was tested with cpython , jython, ironpython and pypy


Linux and Other Unix Variants
=============================

Currently, Linux users must typically install from `source distribution`_

The source distribution will *probably* also install (and function) on most 
other POSIX-compliant Unix variants, as long as all of the dependencies_
are also installed and functional.

Because the PyFirebirdSQL source distribution supports the standard
Python package installation facility (`distutils
<http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/>`__), installing the source
distribution on a typical Linux system is downright easy.


.. _`source distribution`:

Installation from source distribution
*************************************

Shortcut for the Experienced and Impatient::

  (decompress PyFirebirdSQL into *temp_dir*)
  cd *temp_dir*
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install
  python -c "import firebirdsql"
  (delete *temp_dir*)

Then hit the `Usage Guide <usage.html>`__.


Install PyFirebirdSQL
=====================

During this step, the setup script moves the PyFirebirdSQL package
(including the newly compiled C extensions) to the standard package
directory of your Python installation so that Python will be able to
:command:`import firebirdsql` and :command:`import firebirdsql.services`

In addition to the Python code and shared library files actually used
by the Python interpreter, the setup script typically installs some
supporting files, such as documentation. Depending on your system
configuration, these supporting files may be placed in the same
directory or a different directory from the files used by the Python
interpreter.

Run the following command:
:command:`python setup.py install`

The setup script will install PyFirebirdSQL, listing each file it
installs.

Errors during this step are rare because compilation (the finicky part
of this process) has already taken place; installation is really just
a matter of copying files. However, there will be file system
permission errors if the Python installation directory is not writable
by the user running the setup script. If you encounter such an error,
try one of the following:

  - Log in as a user who has the required file system permissions and
    repeat the installation step.

  - Manually copy the directory :file:`build/lib.{platform}-{pyver}/firebirdsql` 
    (which contains the Python modules and compiled library files created during 
    the compilation step) to a directory in your PYTHONPATH. This approach will 
    not install the supporting files, but they are for the benefit of the programmer 
    rather than the Python interpreter anyway.


Test your PyFirebirdSQL installation
************************************

PyFirebirdSQL has an extensive test suite, but it is not really intended for
routine public use.

To verify that PyFirebirdSQL is installed properly, switch to a
directory *other than the temporary directory into which you
decompressed the source distribution* (to avoid conflict between the
copy of firebirdsql in that directory and the copy placed under the
standard Python `site-packages` directory), then verify the
importability of your PyFirebirdSQL installation by issuing the
following command::

  python -c "import firebirdsql as fb; print fb.__version__"

If the import attempt does not encounter any errors and the version
number is what you expected, you are finished. Next, consider reading
the PyFirebirdSQL Usage Guide.

You should not encounter any errors at this stage since you have
already completed the compilation and installation steps successfully.
If you do, please report them to the `firebird-python  support list
<http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/firebird-python/>`__.
