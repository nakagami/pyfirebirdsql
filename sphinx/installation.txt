How to install
=============================

- `Install by pip`_
- Install from `FreeBSD ports collection`_
- Install from `source distribution`_

.. _`Install by pip`:

Install by pip
*************************************

::

  pip instal firebirdsql

.. _`FreeBSD ports collection`:

Installation from FreeBSD ports collection
*********************************************

FreeBSD has it's port now::

  # cd /usr/ports/databases/py-firebirdsql/
  # make install clean

.. _`source distribution`:

Installation from source distribution
*************************************

Shortcut for the Experienced and Impatient::

  (decompress pyfirebirdsql into *temp_dir*)
  cd *temp_dir*
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install
  python -c "import firebirdsql"
  (delete *temp_dir*)

Then hit the `Usage Guide <usage.html>`__.


Test your pyfirebirdsql installation
************************************

pyfirebirdsql has an extensive test suite, but it is not really intended for
routine public use.

To verify that pyfirebirdsql is installed properly, switch to a
directory *other than the temporary directory into which you
decompressed the source distribution* (to avoid conflict between the
copy of firebirdsql in that directory and the copy placed under the
standard Python `site-packages` directory), then verify the
importability of your pyfirebirdsql installation by issuing the
following command::

  python -c "import firebirdsql as fb; print fb.__version__"

If the import attempt does not encounter any errors and the version
number is what you expected, you are finished. Next, consider reading
the pyfirebirdsql Usage Guide.

You should not encounter any errors at this stage since you have
already completed the compilation and installation steps successfully.
If you do, please report them to the `firebird-python  support list
<http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/firebird-python/>`__.
